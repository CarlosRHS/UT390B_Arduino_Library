UT390B Laser Distance Meter Library for Arduino
===============================================

This is a library to interface with the cheap but good UT390B Laser Distance Meter using an Arduino.
It supports simple blocking measurements and more advanced asynchronous measurements for time critical projects.

Installation
------------
To install the library just download the .zip file and look [here](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries) for further instructions.
You can also just clone this git repository into you libraries folder:
